# Bypassing-AV

<h2>Description</h2>

⇒  This Repository includes various ways we can bypass the latest antivirus solutions using custom methods including the following:  

• EarlyBird Technique  
• APC Injection  
• DLL Injection  

<h2>Introduction To AV-Bypass</h2>

⇒  In the present day, the internet is widely accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds, allowing them to use it for communication, entertainment, and information acquisition. However, hackers also have access to the internet and can use malicious software to compromise user privacy and important files.

⇒  To protect against such attacks, users often install antivirus software that aims to reduce the risk of device infection. Downloading files from unknown sources, even well-known programs like web browsers, can lead to infection. Therefore, it is essential to download content from trusted and verified sources. If a suspicious file is downloaded, the antivirus software will typically display an appropriate message and move the infected file to quarantine, where it can be cleaned or deleted. User trust in antivirus software is essential, and regular updates of the signature database and the tool itself are important.

⇒  Hackers use various bypassing and evasion techniques to gain access to devices. Antivirus software developers continuously develop new security tactics and update signature databases to combat emerging threats. However, the increasing number of new viruses implies that current protection technologies may not always be sufficient.  

⇒  This repository illustrates popular bypassing techniques and tools that should be detectable by most antivirus programs but also shows that complex attack chains that combine evasion techniques which can bypass modern and commonly-used antiviruses. The paper is structured into nine sections: introduction, related work, security mechanisms, evasion techniques, testing environment, results of research on bypassing antiviruses, discussion, conclusions, and further research directions.
